## 🎮 How It Works

1.  **Join or Create a Room**: Players can join an existing room or create a new one.

2.  **Take Turns**: Players take turns to draw. When it's your turn, you'll get a word to draw. Others will try to guess the word.

3.  **Guess the Word**: Use the chat function to guess the word. Points are awarded for correct guesses.

4.  **Winner**: The player with the most points at the end wins.
